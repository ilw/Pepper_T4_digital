All notable changes to the Pepper ADC design will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## v0.0.1 - 2025-10-11 


### Added

 - Low power SAR mode that disables the loop-filter for 10 bit SAR operation
 - Digital and Analog test signals and DFT controls
 - Decimation filter with reconfigurable over-sampling ratios
 - Overflow detection on decimation logic
 - Multiple new analog tests checking individual amplifier and feedback 
   performance metrics over PVT and biasing points.
 - Multiple new digital tests checking internal timing and register states
 - Signal and circuit documentation


### Changed

 - Using a simpler majority-vote comparator design for digital denoising 
   opposed to the slower analog denoising
 - Adjusted SAR asynchronous timing to operate at 50 MHz instead of 200 MHz
 - Switched capacitor switches are now fully complementary for low-voltage 
   operation
 

### Removed

 - Second-Order Mismatch Error Shaping
 - Loop-filter cascode devices to allow for lower voltage operation
 - Output data serializer


### Fixed

 - Significantly reduced loading on the common-mode reference voltage
   Only loop-filter and MES LSB is using VCM. Previously it was used in the 
   MSB switching.
 - Comparator noise is evaluated using PSS not tran-noise
 - Significantly improved circuit hierarchy and CDAC switch reuse
