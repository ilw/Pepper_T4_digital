**Model:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet / Claude 3 Opus
**Task:** 2.2 FIFO Documentation

**Context:**
The FIFO in this design handles clock domain crossing and has specific "look-ahead" behavior.

**Files to Reference (Copy content of these into the model context):**
*   `source/FIFO.v`

**Prompt to copy-paste:**
```markdown
Please act as a Senior Digital Design Engineer.

**Files to Reference (Copy content of these into the model context):**
*   `source/FIFO.v`

**Goal:**
Document the `FIFO` module.

**Input File:**
`source/FIFO.v`

**Task:**
Create a file `docs/core_blocks/fifo.md`.

**Requirements:**
1.  **Architecture**:
    *   Explain that this is an asynchronous FIFO (separate Read/Write clocks).
    *   Explain the Gray Code pointer interaction for full/empty generation.
2.  **Look-Ahead Behavior**:
    *   Analyze the read interface. Does data appear on `rdata` immediately when `rempty` goes low, or does it require a `rinc` pulse first?
    *   **Clarify this behavior explicitly** as it is a common integration pitfall.
3.  **Diagrams**:
    *   **Mermaid Class Diagram (Conceptual)**: Show the read domain vs write domain components.
    *   **WaveDrom**: Show a "Write until Full" and "Read until Empty" sequence.
4.  **Flags**:
    *   Define exact conditions for Full, Empty, Overflow, Underflow.

**Output:**
A complete Markdown file.
