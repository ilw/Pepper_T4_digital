Please act as a Technical Writer / Release Engineer.

**Goal:**
Compile and Review the documentation site.

**Context:**
We have generated several documentation files in `docs/` following the `ai_notes/documentation_plan.md`.

**Task:**
1.  **Review Structure**:
    *   Review `mkdocs.yml` (if it exists) or propose one to ensure all new files are linked in the navigation.
    *   File list to check:
        *   `docs/system_overview/block_diagram.md`
        *   `docs/functional/status_logic.md`
        *   `docs/peripherals/atm_control.md`
        *   `docs/peripherals/temp_sense.md`
        *   (And any others found in `docs/`)
2.  **Integration Guide**:
    *   Create a file `docs/index.md` (or update it) to serve as the landing page.
    *   It should provide a brief introduction and links to the major sections.
3.  **Build Instructions**:
    *   Provide a short snippet of how to build/serve the docs (e.g. `mkdocs serve`).

**Output:**
*   Updated `mkdocs.yml` content.
*   New/Updated `docs/index.md`.
