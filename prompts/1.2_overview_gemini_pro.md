**Model:** Gemini 3 Pro (or higher)
**Task:** 1.2 System Overview & Theory of Operation

**Context:**
You need to explain the high-level operation of the Pepper_T4 chip based on the top-level Verilog files.

**Files to Reference (Copy content of these into the model context):**
*   `source/TLM.v` (Top Level Module)
*   `source/Command_Interpreter.v`
*   `source/Status_Monitor.v`

**Prompt to copy-paste:**

**Files to Reference (Copy content of these into the model context):**
*   `source/TLM.v` (Top Level Module)
*   `source/Command_Interpreter.v`
*   `source/Status_Monitor.v`

Please act as an Expert Hardware Engineer and Technical Writer.

**Goal:**
Write a "System Overview" for the Pepper_T4 Digital Logic.

**Input Files:**
*   `TLM.v`: The top-level module connecting everything.
*   `Command_Interpreter.v`: The main control interface.
*   `Status_Monitor.v`: The status aggregation block.

**Task:**
Create a file `docs/system_overview.md`.

Content Requirements:
1.  **Introduction**: What is Pepper_T4? (Based on the code, it appears to be a mixed-signal controller/buffer interface).
2.  **Theory of Operation**:
    *   Explain that the system is SPI-controlled.
    *   Explain the data flow: Host -> SPI -> Command Interpreter -> Registers/FIFOs.
3.  **Key Limitations** (CRITICAL):
    *   Note that sampling is controlled by `ENSAMP`.
    *   Explain any constraints on when registers can be read/written versus when sampling is active (hint: check `Command_Interpreter.v` for `sys_regs_en` vs `sample_regs_en`).
4.  **Block Summary**:
    *   List the main sub-modules instantiated in `TLM.v` and write a 1-sentence description of each.

Format as clean, professional Markdown.
