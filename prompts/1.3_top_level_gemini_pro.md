Please act as a System Architect.

**Files to Reference (Copy content of these into the model context):**
*   `source/TLM.v` (Top Level Module)

**Goal:**
Create a Top-Level Block Diagram documentation.

**Input Files:**
*   `source/TLM.v`

**Task:**
Create a file `docs/system_overview/block_diagram.md`.

**Requirements:**
1.  **Block Diagram Structure**:
    *   Analyze occurrences of submodules in `TLM.v` to identify the major blocks (SPI core, Command Interpreter, FIFO, Status Monitor, ATM, Register CRC, Config Registers, etc.).
    *   List the connections between them based on the wire names in `TLM.v`.
    *   Ideally, create a **Mermaid flowchart** representing these connections (Flowchart LR).
2.  **Interface Description**:
    *   Document the top-level IO ports of the `TLM` module.
    *   Group them logicaly (SPI, Power/Resets, ADC Interface, Test/Debug).

**Output:**
A complete Markdown file `docs/system_overview/block_diagram.md` containing the diagram code and IO table.
